It means the audience is enveloped within            the space, not just observing from outside. Listening to music, to me, is not simply about hearing            sound—it’s about learning the stories and people behind it, and finding inspiration to think, “Ah, they can            do that—so can we, as Vietnamese.” First comes pride; then comes reflection on what each of us can do as            Vietnamese citizens who wish to contribute positively to society.</p><p>The most sophisticated technology is the kind you don’t see but can feel. For instance, this concert uses            one of France’s leading acoustic systems with “Immersed” technology—allowing the audience to be surrounded            by sound instead of hearing it coming from visible speakers. The space becomes a living soundscape—no            visible lights or speakers, only pure sensation through light, sound, and even fragrance.</p><p>All the artists in this concert share a humble, soulful spirit. They are acclaimed names, yet they never            seek to display themselves—they let their music speak. Our job is to translate and extend that spirit to the            audience through every layer of stagecraft and technology.</p><p>I can only say that this program uses the finest equipment currently available in Vietnam—the most advanced            and premium technology. The band’s technical standards are extremely high; without the best systems, you            can’t truly express the nuances of jazz. Jazz, like classical music, demands absolute clarity—even the            softest brush of a cymbal or the faintest breath through a horn must be heard. That’s why we’ve brought in            international sound specialists to work with Vietnam’s top-tier technology.</p><p>How does Vietnam’s performance technology compare with other countries in Asia?</p><p>Performance technology involves many factors—human expertise, market structure, and cultural context.            Abroad, most shows are ticketed, whereas in Vietnam, many events are free or brand-sponsored, which changes            the dynamics. Only when audiences buy tickets can we truly call it a “cultural industry.” In Vietnam, those            two models are still often confused.</p><p>Another common confusion is between live shows and reality programs. For example, reality TV artists often            bring their shows to the stage, but those are still reality-based productions. In contrast, global acts—like            Blackpink—feature one group or performer who creates an entire show around their identity. Here, we tend to            gather dozens of stars in one event, which dilutes the artistic concept.</p><p>Absolutely. The philosophy of “entertainment as education” has guided my work for years. I learn technology            quickly, but the deeper “educational message” in art takes time and conscious effort—built collectively by            producers, performers, and audiences alike.</p><p>Trends come and go, but what endures is the core—the lasting values of tradition and beauty. Sustainable            entertainment means preserving what is authentically Vietnamese while continuing to develop it. The            technologies we borrow from the world are merely tools.</p><p>Niels Lan Doky, a world-renowned Danish jazz artist, plays Western music, yet in this program, the finale            returns to Vietnamese instruments and spirit.

In Vietnam, we are still counting lights, audience numbers, and revenue — but real art            lives in the uncountable: emotion, imprint, and experience.

      "content": "<p>Although Vietnamese communities around the world are leaving their mark in many fields, their stories              have yet to deeply resonate within the domestic public.</p><p>Geographical borders are no longer limits for the movement of Vietnamese people. Over the decades,              millions have left their homeland to study, work, or seek new opportunities, forming a global community              spread across continents. Today, around six million Vietnamese live in more than 130 countries and              territories.</p><p>This gap reveals a lack of storytelling about the global Vietnamese experience — across research, arts,              entrepreneurship, and innovation — leaving domestic audiences with only fragmented glimpses and few              opportunities to connect or be inspired by the overseas community.</p><p>Meanwhile, “soft heritage” — the spiritual, artistic, and cultural dimensions of Vietnamese identity —              remains underexplored. These values not only reflect how Vietnamese culture is represented globally but              also help bridge generations and communities across the world.</p><p>“Highlighting outstanding Vietnamese figures abroad isn’t about personal glorification,” said Ms. Huong.              “It’s about allowing both Vietnamese and international audiences to see real journeys — that generations              of Vietnamese have stepped out into the world, studied, worked, and taken on complex responsibilities, all              within their capabilities.”</p><p>Yet in Vietnam, his name remains little known — a clear example of the “recognition gap” Ms. Huong              referred to. The IMMERSED concert, therefore, is not only Doky’s return to his roots but also a chance for              an overseas Vietnamese artist to bridge that distance with his homeland through music.</p><p>For Ms. Huong, Living Heritage is not merely a series of artistic events. It is a living archive —              documenting outstanding Vietnamese individuals so that their values and stories can be preserved and              passed on to future generations.</p><p>“Living Heritage is not only about remembering the past; it’s a space to nurture heritage for the              future,” Ms. Huong shared. “Music is the fastest way to reach people’s hearts. Through melodies, we              believe the humility, elegance, and resilience of the Vietnamese spirit can be shared with generations to              come.”</p><img src=\"../assets/media/shared/news/nguoi-viet-gan-nhau-hon-nho-di-san-cho-tuong-lai-2.jpg\">",

      "htmlContent": "<p>Although Vietnamese communities around the world are leaving their mark in many fields, their stories              have yet to deeply resonate within the domestic public.</p><p>Geographical borders are no longer limits for the movement of Vietnamese people. Over the decades,              millions have left their homeland to study, work, or seek new opportunities, forming a global community              spread across continents. Today, around six million Vietnamese live in more than 130 countries and              territories.</p><p>This gap reveals a lack of storytelling about the global Vietnamese experience — across research, arts,              entrepreneurship, and innovation — leaving domestic audiences with only fragmented glimpses and few              opportunities to connect or be inspired by the overseas community.</p><p>Meanwhile, “soft heritage” — the spiritual, artistic, and cultural dimensions of Vietnamese identity —              remains underexplored. These values not only reflect how Vietnamese culture is represented globally but              also help bridge generations and communities across the world.</p><p>“Highlighting outstanding Vietnamese figures abroad isn’t about personal glorification,” said Ms. Huong.              “It’s about allowing both Vietnamese and international audiences to see real journeys — that generations              of Vietnamese have stepped out into the world, studied, worked, and taken on complex responsibilities, all              within their capabilities.”</p><p>Yet in Vietnam, his name remains little known — a clear example of the “recognition gap” Ms. Huong              referred to. The IMMERSED concert, therefore, is not only Doky’s return to his roots but also a chance for              an overseas Vietnamese artist to bridge that distance with his homeland through music.</p><p>For Ms. Huong, Living Heritage is not merely a series of artistic events. It is a living archive —              documenting outstanding Vietnamese individuals so that their values and stories can be preserved and              passed on to future generations.</p><p>“Living Heritage is not only about remembering the past; it’s a space to nurture heritage for the              future,” Ms. Huong shared. “Music is the fastest way to reach people’s hearts. Through melodies, we              believe the humility, elegance, and resilience of the Vietnamese spirit can be shared with generations to              come.”</p><img src=\"../assets/media/shared/news/nguoi-viet-gan-nhau-hon-nho-di-san-cho-tuong-lai-2.jpg\">"
