            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
              This review article explores the possible role of Chinese medicine (CM) in modulating stem cells for
              regenerative
              medicine, synthesizing evidence from animal experiments and human trials. The article focuses on how CM
              modulates
              the stem cell environment, specifically their roles in delaying cellular senescence and promoting stem
              cell
              survival, enhancing proliferation and differentiation, as well as stimulating exosome secretion.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also conducts a critical analysis of methodological rigor and clinical transparency within the included
              studies
              to enable a more objective assessment of their reliability and reproducibility. To guarantee the
              responsible
              integration of CM and stem cells in future clinical application, it also discusses the safety, efficacy,
              and
              heterogeneity of stem cells, as well as delivery methods, alongside the dose–response relationship of CM.
            </p>
            <p>
              The current evidence for CM in stem cell therapy remains constrained by the absence of standardized
              comparative
              baselines in animal studies and clinical outcome assessment. This methodological gap not only compromises
              the
              evidentiary weight of herbal effects but also introduces confounding variables in studies. The elucidation
              of CM’s
              mechanistic role in stem cell therapeutics necessitates robust interdisciplinary collaboration; this is an
              imperative and critically urgent need within a peer-reviewed research framework.
            </p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Regenerative medicine is a biomedical discipline aimed at repair or replacement of damaged, diseased, or
              metabolically
              deficient organs, tissues, and cells via tissue engineering, cell transplantation, artificial organs or
              bioartificial
              organs and tissues.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stem cell-based therapy is a branch of regenerative medicine, wherein stem cells are able to differentiate
              into
              various types of cells under specific conditions. Stem cells have shown broad prospects in the field of
              regenerative
              medicine. Through asymmetric division, they not only replenish the stem cell pool but also differentiate
              into
              tissue-specific cells to perform particular physiological functions in growth, development, repair, and
              regeneration.
              Their effectiveness in tissue repair and regeneration is remarkable, making them a hotspot in medical
              research.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crucially, distinct stem cell lineages exhibit divergent biological properties that directly impact their
              clinical
              translation. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have long been controversial due to ethical concerns regarding
              their source,
              which limits their application in clinical research. Preclinical studies have found that ESCs lack immune
              privilege
              and are subject to immunological rejection. Additionally, the risk of malignancy further restricts
              ESC-based treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be reprogrammed from adult somatic cells and differentiate into
              neural cells
              and cardiomyocytes, ushering in an era of personalized medicine. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),
              characterized by abundant
              sources, low immunogenicity, and immunomodulatory properties, have become a vital component in
              regenerative medicine.
              Other adult stem cells such as intestinal stem cells (ISCs), hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs), and neural
              stem cells (NSCs)
              are responsible for growth and repair of specific tissues.
            </p>
            <p>
              Given the obstacles in stem cell therapy, Chinese medicine (CM) could provide multi-target interventions
              to attenuate
              these effects. Existing studies have found that CM may support stem cell-based therapy by enhancing
              survival rate,
              promoting migration and retention, stimulating angiogenesis, reducing immune rejection, guiding
              directional differentiation,
              and improving proliferation and differentiation capabilities of stem cells.
            </p>

            <h3>Biological mechanisms and examples</h3>
            <p>
              CM is a complex system composed of multiple bioactive constituents. Modern research identifies active CM
              components
              including alkaloids (e.g., berberine, rhynchophylline, ephedrine), volatile oils (e.g., menthol, eugenol,
              camphor), and
              glycosides (e.g., ginsenosides, notoginsenosides, baicalin). These compounds can modulate stem cell
              behaviors such as
              proliferation, differentiation, anti-inflammation, and antioxidation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Preclinical studies provide preliminary evidence for synergistic effects between CM and MSCs. For example,
              Ma et al.
              observed that combining BMSCs with the Bushen Huoxue Huazhuo formula in a liver fibrosis model enhanced
              BMSC colonization in
              liver tissue, reduced hepatocyte apoptosis, suppressed pathological injury, and decreased fibrosis markers
              compared with monotherapy.
            </p>
            <p>
              A common limitation is the lack of mechanistic depth: many studies show associations between combined
              therapy and improved
              outcomes without defining molecular causation or specific interaction pathways between CM components and
              stem cells.
              Therefore, rigorously designed clinical trials are necessary to validate efficacy, safety, and mechanisms
              in humans.
            </p>

            <h3>CM modulates the stem cell environment</h3>
            <p>
              The stem cell environment includes the specific niche and systemic conditions that influence cell
              behavior. CM formulas
              show potential to modulate this environment by adjusting cytokines, growth factors, and immune status.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clinical evidence suggests kidney-tonifying strategies may promote liver regeneration and repair in
              chronic hepatitis B-related
              liver failure, potentially via effects on stem cells and their microenvironment. The Diwu Yanggan compound
              has been shown to
              modulate IL-1, VEGF, and GRO/KC, thereby influencing the hepatic stem cell microenvironment in a rat
              injury model.
            </p>
            <p>
              CM also exhibits systemic immunomodulatory properties that can enhance stem cell survival and improve the
              therapeutic milieu.
              In an allergic rhinitis model, MSCs treated with Qi-fang-Bi-min-tang reduced proinflammatory factors and
              increased splenic Treg
              proportions and plasma TGF-β1. In ischemia models, combined curcumin and hUC-MSC therapy suppressed
              proinflammatory cytokines
              and oxidative mediators while boosting antiinflammatory cytokines and antioxidant activity.
            </p>

            <h3>Growth factors</h3>
            <p>
              CM can upregulate key growth factors such as HGF, VEGF, FGF, IGF-1, PDGF, and BMP-2, which regulate
              proliferation, differentiation,
              and survival. For example, combining Lugua polypeptides with UC-MSCs improved rheumatoid arthritis
              outcomes by increasing HGF expression.
            </p>
            <p>
              In myocardial infarction models, combining iPSC-derived therapies with a modified Taohong Siwu decoction
              improved cardiac function,
              reduced infarct size, and increased VEGF and FGF, potentially due to blood-activating and stasis-resolving
              effects that improve
              hemodynamics and cell retention.
            </p>

            <h3>CM delays stem cell senescence</h3>
            <p>
              Stem cell senescence involves epigenetic alterations, proteostasis dysfunction, ROS accumulation, and
              activation of p53/p21/p16
              pathways. Growing evidence suggests CM can delay senescence by reducing ROS, activating Nrf2, regulating
              autophagy, and stabilizing
              organelle function such as mitochondria.
            </p>
            <p>
              Examples include Guilu Erxian Jiao reducing p16, p53, and p21 expression in chemotherapy-induced senescent
              HSCs; Liuwei Dihuang Wan
              protecting BMSCs via the YAP–autophagy axis; Zuogui Wan activating Nrf2 in ovarian aging models; and
              Erxian decoction inducing plasma
              exosomes that rescued mitophagy in senescent BMSCs.
            </p>

            <h3>Proliferation & differentiation — key signaling pathways</h3>
            <p>
              CM promotes stem cell proliferation and differentiation through Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK/ERK
              pathways.
            </p>

            <h4>1. Wnt/β-catenin pathway</h4>
            <p>
              CM can activate Wnt signaling (e.g., increase Wnt3a) and stem cell markers (Lgr5, Sox2, Ki67, PCNA),
              supporting proliferation and
              differentiation across tissues. Berberine promoted stromal Wnt expression to aid mucosal repair; ginseng
              inhibited GSK-3β to stabilize
              β-catenin; oleanolic acid inhibited GSK-3β to drive NSC proliferation.
            </p>

            <h4>2. PI3K/AKT pathway</h4>
            <p>
              Many CM formulas and compounds (e.g., Astragalus, Gualou Xiebai Banxia, Ginsenoside Rg1) enhance PI3K/AKT
              phosphorylation, counteracting
              hypoxia-ischemia-induced apoptosis in BMSCs and promoting survival, proliferation, and beneficial
              autophagy.
            </p>

            <h4>3. MAPK/ERK pathway</h4>
            <p>
              MAPK/ERK signaling is a convergence point for CM compounds regulating proliferation, differentiation, and
              functional restoration
              in neurological, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal contexts (e.g., Astragaloside IV, berberine,
              naringin).
            </p>

            <h3>Homing, engraftment and survival of stem cells</h3>
            <p>
              CM supports homing and engraftment by modulating chemokines and receptors such as SCF and SDF-1/CXCR4.
              Preparations like Xuesaitong,
              Danhong injection, and Guanxin Danshen have been reported to increase SCF or SDF-1 and/or CXCR4 expression
              on MSCs, improving retention
              and repair capacity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Compounds such as resveratrol improved survival and engraftment of hUC-MSCs in Alzheimer’s models with
              functional benefits. CM may also
              mitigate complications like GVHD via modulation of TGF-β1, BMPs, and NF-κB pathways to support cell
              survival.
            </p>

            <h3>CM and stem cell-derived exosomes (SC-Exos)</h3>
            <p>
              SC-Exos (30–150 nm) carry proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and miRNAs, mediating intercellular communication and
              playing key roles in tissue repair
              and immune regulation. CM can enhance SC-Exos secretion and alter cargo composition, enriching protective
              and antiinflammatory miRNAs
              (e.g., miR-146a-5p, miR-223-5p, miR-133a-3p, miR-138-5p).
            </p>
            <p>
              Examples: Tongxinluo preconditioning enriched MSC exosomes with miR-146a-5p (targeting IRAK2 → reduced
              NF-κB); Tanshinone IIA increased
              miR-223-5p to inhibit CCR2 and reduce inflammation; Lycium barbarum polysaccharide enriched NSC-Exos with
              miR-133a-3p (activating AMPK/mTOR);
              catalpol promoted NSC exosomes with miR-138-5p to support neural survival.
            </p>

            <h3>Additional regulatory effects</h3>
            <p>
              CM also enhances tissue perfusion, modulates gene expression, influences cellular metabolism, and
              regulates intercellular interactions,
              thereby optimizing the stem cell niche. For instance, CM can increase microvessel density (CD31) around
              grafts, modulate Notch in cancer
              stem cells, or elevate spermidine to support eIF5A hypusination and activate dormant stem cells.
            </p>

            <h3>Challenges & future prospects</h3>
            <p>
              Although combining CM and stem cell therapy holds promise, three major challenges must be addressed:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Theoretical and methodological differences:</strong> CM emphasizes individualized syndrome
                differentiation while stem cell
                therapy requires standardized protocols. New integrative frameworks are needed for clinical evaluation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interdisciplinary collaboration gaps:</strong> A shortage of researchers proficient in both CM
                and stem cell biology hinders
                effective translational research; multidisciplinary teams are essential.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Translational discrepancies:</strong> Much mechanistic research is in vitro or in animal models,
                whereas clinical delivery
                often uses systemic infusion. This mismatch may affect outcomes and complicate translation to human
                trials.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Future research should focus on pathologies where both CM and stem cells have mechanistic relevance,
              standardize protocols, optimize dosing,
              delivery routes and timing, and perform rigorous clinical trials to establish efficacy and safety.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              Stem cell therapy holds significant promise for treating a wide spectrum of diseases and injuries. CM
              offers substantial potential to optimize
              this approach by modulating the stem cell environment, delaying senescence, promoting proliferation and
              differentiation, facilitating homing
              and engraftment, enhancing survival, stimulating exosome secretion, and exerting other beneficial effects.
              The strategic integration of CM
              with stem cell therapy therefore represents a compelling approach to improve treatment efficacy for
              various refractory conditions. While
              significant challenges remain, ongoing research provides encouraging progress. Future efforts must
              prioritize optimizing treatment protocols
              and conducting rigorous clinical validation to firmly establish the therapeutic advantages of this
              synergistic combination.
