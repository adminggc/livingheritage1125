        Director Phạm Hoàng Nam: “The Reunion of Niels Lan Doky and Thanh Lam Will Be Explosive”
      </h2>


      <div class="news-text-columns">
        <div class="news-text">
          <p><em>"Lan Doky always brings surprises, while Thanh Lam is pure emotion and instinct — when these two meet,
              sparks will fly,"</em> director Phạm Hoàng Nam said.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after his last performance in his homeland, the "Jazz Knight" Niels Lan Doky — the
            Danish-Vietnamese piano legend — will return to Vietnam for <strong>Jazz Concert – IMMERSED</strong>, taking
            place on November 15 in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>

          <p>The show is part of the <strong>Living Heritage (Legacy for the Future)</strong> project and brings
            together director Phạm Hoàng Nam, Music Director Quốc Trung, and leading artists including People’s Artist
            Thanh Lam, Hà Trần, and Quyền Thiện Đắc. For this occasion, Dân Trí interviewed the "stage magician" Phạm
            Hoàng Nam — the concert's director — to reveal more about the show and the eagerly awaited meeting between
            Niels Lan Doky and diva Thanh Lam.</p>

          <p><strong>"Difference Is Not Something to Fear"</strong></p>

          <p><em>Looking back on your thirty years directing stages and concerts, what artistic philosophy and personal
              signature do you always bring to your projects?</em></p>

          <p>"Thirty years into this profession, what I have kept is: always be yourself. I don't chase trends because a
            work only has value when it carries the creator's unique 'fingerprint' — something that cannot be copied or
            repeated. That difference is what sustains me.</p>

          <p>To me, light is a language, not merely a tool. It doesn't just illuminate performers, it reveals the soul
            of the music. A single well-placed beam can move an audience to tears; a forest of dazzling lights may only
            tire their eyes. I value sufficiency, refinement, and truth. Today, the world seems obsessed with numbers —
            ticket counts, audience size, LED screens, fireworks — but what can be counted has limits. The greatest
            value lies in what cannot be measured."</p>

          <p><em>How do you draw the line between a bold idea and one that risks failure?</em></p>

          <p>"Creativity is inherently risky — my rule is never to repeat others or myself. That risk is the excitement.
            Success rests on experience and the team. You push bold ideas as far as possible, while minimizing risk with
            professional preparation and a shared vision. I prefer to work with the best — humble people who hide behind
            the art so the work can shine."</p>

              alt="Director Pham Hoang Nam: The Reunion of Niels Lan Doky and Thanh Lam Will Be Explosive"
              class="article-image img-fluid">
          </figure>

          <p><strong>"IMMERSED" — More Than a Jazz Concert</strong></p>

          <p><em>What made you accept IMMERSED — a jazz concert — and invest your heart in it, even though jazz is not
              mainstream in Vietnam?</em></p>

          <p>"IMMERSED is the opening chapter of the Living Heritage project initiated by Helen Lưu (Lưu Bảo Hương) and
            collaborators. The project's core is to honor exceptional Vietnamese talents worldwide who remain little
            known at home — doctors, philosophers, economists, artists, designers — and to inspire younger generations
            that Vietnamese people can achieve greatness internationally through their own identity.</p>

          <p>I joined because I share the project's life philosophy: balance of mind and body, harmony with nature, and
            authenticity. I'm not only the show's director but also one of the figures in the Living Heritage book. We
            aim to tell a story, not just stage a concert."</p>

          <p><em>How did the idea for a jazz concert arise?</em></p>

          <p>"The project starts from people and their stories, not a specific musical genre. This time we chose jazz
            because the central figure is Niels Lan Doky — a Vietnamese-Danish jazz artist and the only Vietnamese
            knighted by the Queen of Denmark. Lan Doky is well-known in Europe but less familiar in Vietnam. His return
            is a homecoming — blending Western jazz with Vietnamese instruments and folk sensibilities."</p>

          <p><strong>When Two Souls Collide</strong></p>

          <p><em>How will you tell the reunion story on stage so the chemistry between Lan Doky and Thanh Lam is fully
              felt?</em></p>

          <p>"The show unfolds like chapters, with Lan Doky as the storyteller, tracing his journey of leaving and
            returning, finding Vietnamese friends like Thanh Lam and Quốc Trung. I first met Lan Doky in Denmark in 2008
            — despite his global success, he plays with a distinctly Asian sensitivity. He discovered Vietnamese music
            through old Thúy Nga Paris recordings and became fascinated by Thanh Lam's voice. As director, I create the
            framework for both strong personalities to shine while leaving room for spontaneous magic."</p>

          <p><em>Where does the chemistry between the 'Jazz Knight' and the 'Vietnamese Diva' come from?</em></p>

          <p>"Jazz is improvisation. Both artists carry that spirit. Lan Doky surprises; Thanh Lam is raw emotion and
            instinct — she never repeats herself. When these two meet, the harmony will be explosively interesting."</p>

          <p><strong>Vietnam Still Lacks Star-Making Producers</strong></p>

          <p><em>With technology advancing, how has the director’s role changed, and what defines a world-class
              concert?</em></p>

          <p>"Globally, great concerts are not measured by LED screens or fireworks but by how the concept and the
            artist move people. In Vietnam, we are still counting lights, audience numbers, and revenue — but real art
            lives in the uncountable: emotion, imprint, and experience. I always remind myself: 'What can be counted has
            limits; emotion is limitless.'"</p>

          <p><em>What is the biggest barrier to Vietnamese artists reaching global stature?</em></p>

          <p>"The main issue is not the singers — it's the lack of visionary producers. Talented artists need producers
            who can nurture them from obscurity to global brands. That 'star-making' technology is still rare in
            Vietnam. Additionally, many songs remain in Vietnamese; to reach the world, strategic language choices and
            international production mindsets are necessary. But when our message is honest and distinctive, music
            transcends borders."</p>

          <p><em>If you could leave one legacy for the next generation of directors and artists, what would it be?</em>
          </p>

          <p>"Be different — but be true. Do not fear risk, but learn balance: between passion and discipline,
            creativity and responsibility, logic and emotion. Technology can be learned, money can be earned, but
            identity must be found. When you discover your own fingerprint, competition becomes irrelevant. Above all,
            stay humble. Work more, talk less. Let audiences judge your art."</p>

          <p>Thank you for sharing your insights.</p>
