          <div class="news-text">
            <p>Although Vietnamese communities around the world are leaving their mark in many fields, their stories
              have yet to deeply resonate within the domestic public.</p>

            <p>Geographical borders are no longer limits for the movement of Vietnamese people. Over the decades,
              millions have left their homeland to study, work, or seek new opportunities, forming a global community
              spread across continents. Today, around six million Vietnamese live in more than 130 countries and
              territories.</p>

            <p>In the past three decades, overseas Vietnamese have sent home over <strong>190 billion USD</strong> in
              remittances — equivalent to nearly 90% of total disbursed FDI in the same period. In 2023 alone,
              remittances reached a record <strong>16 billion USD</strong>, up more than 32% from the previous year — a
              testament to the enduring connection between the global Vietnamese community and their homeland, even amid
              a volatile world economy.</p>

            <p>Yet the influence of Vietnamese people abroad cannot be measured by remittances alone. They are
              increasingly visible in research institutes, tech firms, financial organizations, universities, and
              creative industries worldwide. According to the State Committee for Overseas Vietnamese, roughly
              <strong>600,000 Vietnamese intellectuals and experts</strong> are working in more than 70 countries.
              However, their achievements often remain confined to specialized domains — meaning the public at home
              still knows little about them.</p>

            <p>“Many Vietnamese living abroad hold important positions but rarely appear in the media,” noted
              <strong>Ms. Luu Bao Huong</strong>, Chairwoman of GG Corporation (GGC). “That makes domestic perceptions
              of Vietnamese people on the international stage sometimes incomplete.”</p>

            <p>This gap reveals a lack of storytelling about the global Vietnamese experience — across research, arts,
              entrepreneurship, and innovation — leaving domestic audiences with only fragmented glimpses and few
              opportunities to connect or be inspired by the overseas community.</p>

            <p>In Ireland, for example, the <em>Global Irish Network</em> brings together over 300 business leaders and
              professionals from 30 countries, serving as a bridge between the Irish diaspora and government agencies in
              investment, trade, and education. India hosts its biennial <em>Pravasi Bharatiya Divas</em> (Day of the
              Indian Diaspora) to honor distinguished expatriates and foster dialogue between the government and
              overseas Indians on economic, scientific, and cultural cooperation.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>In Vietnam, both the public and private sectors are also working to strengthen connections with overseas
              intellectuals and professionals. The <em>Vietnam Innovation Network (VNI)</em>, founded in 2018,
              exemplifies this effort — linking Vietnamese experts and scientists at home and abroad to share knowledge,
              support research, entrepreneurship, and technology development. Initiatives like these are gradually
              shaping Vietnam’s human infrastructure for the integration era, though the focus still leans heavily
              toward science, technology, and economics.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, “soft heritage” — the spiritual, artistic, and cultural dimensions of Vietnamese identity —
              remains underexplored. These values not only reflect how Vietnamese culture is represented globally but
              also help bridge generations and communities across the world.</p>

            <p>Recognizing that gap, <strong>Ms. Luu Bao Huong</strong> and GG Corporation initiated the <strong>Living
                Heritage</strong> project, which honors accomplished and inspiring Vietnamese individuals on the global
              stage while connecting them more closely with audiences at home. Beginning as an online database and
              annual publication, Living Heritage is gradually expanding into a series of professional activities and
              artistic events — spaces where knowledge and emotion converge.</p>

            <p>“Highlighting outstanding Vietnamese figures abroad isn’t about personal glorification,” said Ms. Huong.
              “It’s about allowing both Vietnamese and international audiences to see real journeys — that generations
              of Vietnamese have stepped out into the world, studied, worked, and taken on complex responsibilities, all
              within their capabilities.”</p>

            <p>Living Heritage begins its journey with a concert — and it’s no coincidence that the central figure is
              jazz pianist <strong>Niels Lan Doky</strong>, a Vietnamese-Danish artist of mixed heritage. Twenty years
              after his last performance in his father’s homeland, Doky will once again sit at the piano in Ho Chi Minh
              City, at the IMMERSED concert on November 15.</p>

            <p>A graduate of <em>Berklee College of Music</em>, Niels Lan Doky has released 46 albums, performed at
              renowned venues such as <em>Carnegie Hall</em> (New York) and <em>Royal Albert Hall</em> (London), and
              collaborated with jazz legends John Scofield and Pat Metheny. For his lasting contributions to the arts,
              he was knighted by Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.</p>

            <p>Yet in Vietnam, his name remains little known — a clear example of the “recognition gap” Ms. Huong
              referred to. The IMMERSED concert, therefore, is not only Doky’s return to his roots but also a chance for
              an overseas Vietnamese artist to bridge that distance with his homeland through music.</p>

            <p>For Ms. Huong, Living Heritage is not merely a series of artistic events. It is a living archive —
              documenting outstanding Vietnamese individuals so that their values and stories can be preserved and
              passed on to future generations.</p>

            <p>“Living Heritage is not only about remembering the past; it’s a space to nurture heritage for the
              future,” Ms. Huong shared. “Music is the fastest way to reach people’s hearts. Through melodies, we
              believe the humility, elegance, and resilience of the Vietnamese spirit can be shared with generations to
              come.”</p>
