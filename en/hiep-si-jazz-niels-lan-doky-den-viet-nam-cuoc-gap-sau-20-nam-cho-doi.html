        <div class="news-text">
          <p>After 20 years, <strong>“Jazz Knight” Niels Lan Doky</strong> returns to Vietnam for a special music
            program. For him, this is not merely a concert, but a heartfelt reunion with his audience and homeland.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after his last performance in his native country, “Jazz Knight” <strong>Niels Lan
              Doky</strong> — the Vietnamese-Danish piano legend — will make his return to Vietnam for <strong>Jazz
              Concert IMMERSED</strong>, taking place on November 15 in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>

          <p>The concert is part of the <strong>Living Heritage</strong> project, an initiative celebrating “heritage
            for the future,” featuring stage director <strong>Pham Hoang Nam</strong>, music director <strong>Quoc
              Trung</strong>, and top Vietnamese artists such as People’s Artist <strong>Thanh Lam</strong>, <strong>Ha
              Tran</strong>, and <strong>Quyen Thien Dac</strong>.</p>

          <h4>A Rare Serendipity — A Reunion After Two Decades</h4>

          <p>According to <strong>Mrs. Luu Bao Huong</strong>, Chairwoman of GG Corporation, the event’s organizer,
            Doky’s participation came from what she called “a rare stroke of fate.”</p>

          <p>“More than 20 years ago, Niels Lan Doky collaborated with Quoc Trung and Thanh Lam on several projects. He
            has always held a deep affection for Vietnam, so when we reached out, he accepted our invitation as soon as
            his schedule allowed,” she shared.</p>

          <p>“Working with him has been a true learning experience — from the level of professionalism in organizing an
            international concert, to his disciplined yet graceful and generous approach. Everything he does exudes
            respect and elegance. I believe this collaboration is the result of ‘heaven, earth, and humanity’ aligning
            perfectly — since the schedules of international stars like him are usually extremely tight,” she added.</p>

          <p>Born in Denmark in 1963, <strong>Niels Lan Doky</strong> (Vietnamese name: Đỗ Kỳ Lân) is a world-renowned
            Vietnamese-Danish jazz pianist, widely recognized by the international press as one of the outstanding
            pianists of his generation.</p>

          <p>Currently based in New York City, Doky and his brother <strong>Minh Doky</strong> — a celebrated jazz
            bassist — inherited their musical talent from their father, a classical guitarist of Vietnamese descent.</p>

          <p>In 1979, Doky moved to the United States to study at <em>Berklee College of Music</em>, quickly
            establishing his reputation on the global jazz scene. He has released over 40 albums and performed at
            prestigious venues such as <em>Carnegie Hall</em> (USA), <em>Royal Albert Hall</em> (UK), and <em>Blue
              Note</em> (Tokyo). In 2010, he was knighted by Her Majesty the Queen of Denmark for his exceptional
            contributions to international music.</p>

          <p>In a short video message sent to Vietnamese audiences ahead of the concert, Doky greeted warmly in
            Vietnamese: <em>“Xin chào Việt Nam.”</em> He expressed his excitement about returning to perform in the
            country that holds such a special place in his heart.</p>

          <p>“It has been so long since I last came back. I honestly can’t wait any longer to return to my homeland.
            This time, with my close collaborators, I hope to bring the audience an experience of pure emotional
            immersion. There is so much I want to share,” he said.</p>

          <p>Accompanying Doky are two of his long-time collaborators — <strong>Felix Pastorius</strong> (USA) and
            <strong>Jonas Johansen</strong> (Denmark) — both celebrated figures in contemporary jazz. “They are not
            coming just to perform, but to co-create with us a refined, emotionally rich musical experience that
            connects and honors heritage,” Mrs. Huong said.</p>

          <h4>Awakening Heritage for the Future</h4>

          <p>While Doky’s return marks a long-awaited reunion, for the creative team, it also signifies the beginning of
            a journey to awaken the “heritage” within every Vietnamese soul. The <strong>Living Heritage</strong>
            project aims to preserve, share, and spread the essence of Vietnamese cultural identity across the world.
          </p>

          <p>Alongside Jazz Concert IMMERSED, the digital book <em>The Universal Within</em> will be released later this
            year — offering deep reflections on life lessons and the heritage we build for the future.</p>

          <p>The concert by “Jazz Knight” Niels Lan Doky represents a contemporary slice of Vietnam’s living heritage —
            where Western music meets Eastern spirit, where a Vietnamese-born artist returns home to tell his story
            through music.</p>

          <p>“Living Heritage is not merely a series of artistic events; it is a journey of nurturing and enriching
            heritage — where culture, knowledge, and humanity are passed on through music. Music touches the heart
            faster than any language. Through these melodies, we hope to share the Vietnamese spirit — humble, refined,
            yet full of strength — with generations to come,” Mrs. Huong shared.</p>

          <p>According to her, Jazz Concert IMMERSED is not driven by commercial profit. The entire team sees it as a
            mission — to give Vietnamese audiences the opportunity to experience world-class jazz artistry within an
            international-standard production.</p>

          <p>“If we look at the financial side, it’s certainly not a profitable project. But we’re not doing this for
            money. The greater purpose is to offer a sublime artistic experience — to spread a spirit of meaningful and
            elevated living,” she said.</p>

          <p>Mrs. Huong did not reveal the international artists’ performance fees but confirmed that all expenses —
            from sound and lighting systems to costumes and logistics — were optimized at the highest level of support.
          </p>

          <p>“Fortunately, everything came together smoothly thanks to a shared dedication to art. The artists accepted
            not for financial reasons, but out of goodwill and love for Vietnam,” she emphasized.</p>

          <p>Doky’s stay in Vietnam will be brief — just over 24 hours. He will arrive in Ho Chi Minh City on the
            morning of November 15, perform that evening, and depart the following day due to his busy international
            schedule.</p>

          <p>“We truly value every minute of that short visit — it shows not only his professionalism but also his deep
            affection for the Vietnamese audience,” Mrs. Huong added.</p>

          <p>Diva <strong>Thanh Lam</strong> — who collaborated with Niels Lan Doky over 20 years ago on the album
            <em>Asian Sessions</em> — shared her excitement: “At that time, I was only 30 and had just given birth to my
            third child. Now, as he returns to Vietnam, I’m thrilled to reunite and perform together again. During the
            concert, I’ll be singing some of the songs we recorded for his CD — it’s both nostalgic and exhilarating.”
          </p>

          <p>She also revealed a special duet with singer <strong>Ha Tran</strong>: “We’ve carefully planned our
            performance together. Singing jazz means embracing wide emotional freedom and improvisation, so I believe
            when Ha Tran and I share the stage, we’ll let our emotions lead the way.”</p>
